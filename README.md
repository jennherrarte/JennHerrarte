### Hi there, I'm Jenn ðŸ‘‹

I currently work at PXL Agency, where I get to create beautiful and intuitive applications for clients such as Dreamworks, Netflix, Universal, and the City of Santa Monica.

I enjoy running, reading (*Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow* by Gabrielle Zevin at the moment), and playing with my dog, Scout.
